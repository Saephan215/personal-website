				<h2> My Passions and Core Values </h2>
				<p>  I have three core values that I hold deeply and part of who I am. Challenge myself. Forever Learn. Honesty. All of these are the drivers of my passions. Being a developer, I always look for a new challenge. If I am programming something that I can easily write, it means I am not challenging myself, and not learning. The same goes for my other passions. Playing guitar and singing. If the songs I am learning can be played in one day, I need to start challenging myself again. To keep myself grounded while constantly challenging myself, I believe in building a strong and healthy environment of honesty with grace. These core values and passions are who I am. </p>
